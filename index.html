        <p> Otto von Bismark is one of my favorite historical figures. He accomplished two main
            tasks while alive. First he unified the different states of Germany into an empire.
            While Chancellor, Otto von Bismark kept Germany at peace with other European powers.
            Bismark was a revolutionary conservative and a hero to German nationalists.</p>
